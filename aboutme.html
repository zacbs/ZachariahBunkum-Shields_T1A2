  <h1>About me</h1>
  <section id="part1">
    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>I was born in Brisbane and have lived here most of my life, when I was very young we lived in Forest Lake for a
      time, however my earliest memories begin from when we moved to morning side, where I attended Morningside State
      School for pre-school until year 4, at which point we moved to the northside of brisbane, to the Moreton bay area.
      It was around this time my parents divorced, for the majority of my childhood I would alternate time between
      parents
      on a weekly basis until the end of high school. During primary school I spent 2 years elsewhere as my parents got
      jobs around the country, I spent one year in a mining town in WA called Paraburdoo & one year in Maryborough.</p>
    <h2>Years after school</h2>
    <p>During high school I only attended one school North Lakes State College, during my final year of high school I
      got
      a job at KFC, where started working full time straight after high school, I worked my way up to store manager
      after
      6 years of working at KFC. Over my time there I acheived many things, I worked across 15 resturants in this time
      helping stores that needed it without hestiation. As an assistant manager I helped open a store in Morayfield. I
      also completed my transistion from assistant manager to store manager while helping reopen a store that was closed
      6
      months due to renovations. I also in this time got the privilege to help at the opening off the flagship resturant
      on Queen Street mall.</p>
    <h2>Looking ahead</h2>
    <p>in this last couple months I have been finally thinking about want I want to do with my life and if I want to
      continue down my current path or change careers. Frankly I don't see myself doing what I'm currently doing any
      longer then I have to. I have always had a desire to something tech related, it has always been an interest to me
      it would be amazing to get to do anything related to computers software or hardware related, so I have started
      doing this course at Coder Academy!</p>
